# Module 18: Tableau

## Overview
In this module, we explored **Tableau**, a powerful data visualization and business intelligence tool that enables users to create in-depth and interactive visualizations. The focus of the module was to learn how to load, clean, explore, and visualize data using Tableau, culminating in a hands-on mini-project where we designed dashboards and analyzed datasets to uncover unexpected phenomena.

## Lessons Covered

### 18.1: Introduction to Tableau
In this lesson, we were introduced to the basics of Tableau. The class focused on hands-on practice with:
- Importing and exploring datasets from sources such as CSV files and Excel spreadsheets.
- Performing joins to merge datasets and splitting data fields.
- Creating and customizing charts to visualize key data points.
- Practicing storytelling skills by creating storyboards, such as one illustrating the highest-paid college majors and the impact of graduate school on earnings.

### 18.2: Deeper into Tableau
This lesson expanded on the basics and introduced more advanced features in Tableau:
- Using groups and sets to organize and segment data for better insights.
- Mapping data with geospatial visualizations and integrating U.S. Census data.
- Writing custom calculations and performing **Level of Detail (LOD)** calculations for granular analysis.
- Designing dashboards to combine multiple visualizations into cohesive layouts.

### 18.3: Tableau Mini-Projects
In the final lesson, we applied our Tableau skills in group-based mini-projects. The class began with smaller exercises to refresh concepts such as:
- Analyzing company sales to derive insights through visualizations.
- Exploring airline safety data with dashboards.
- Visualizing baby name popularity trends alongside demographic data.

For the mini-project, each group chose at least two datasets, combined them, and created interactive dashboards and visualizations. The project concluded with a presentation of the findings, highlighting the stories told by the data.

## Final Project: Citi Bike Trip Analysis

The culminating project involved analyzing data from Citi Bike Trip History Logs to uncover two unexpected phenomena. Key tasks included:
1. **Exploratory Analysis:**
   - Aggregating data to answer questions such as total trips recorded, ridership growth, and peak hours for bike usage in different seasons.
   - Investigating user types (e.g., short-term customers vs. annual subscribers) and their behaviors.

2. **Visualizations:**
   - Creating 4â€“10 visualizations (e.g., bar charts, line charts, and heatmaps) to analyze each phenomenon.
   - Designing dashboards to present trends and insights for city officials.

3. **Mapping:**
   - Developing either:
     - A static map displaying bike stations and their popularity with zip code overlays.
     - A dynamic map showing station popularity trends over time.

4. **Dashboard Design:**
   - Combining visualizations into cohesive dashboards with accompanying explanations to highlight insights for city officials.

5. **Presentation:**
   - Preparing a Tableau story to summarize visualizations and findings.
   - Ensuring all elements were professional, visually appealing, and easy to understand for non-analyst stakeholders.

## Key Takeaways
By the end of the module, participants gained hands-on experience with:
- Importing, cleaning, and exploring datasets in Tableau.
- Designing compelling visualizations and dashboards.
- Applying advanced techniques like LOD calculations, custom calculations, and mapping.
- Presenting data-driven insights effectively to non-technical audiences.

This module provided the skills needed to create meaningful visualizations that not only tell a story but also drive actionable insights for decision-makers.
